 * Open registry of device-action command types. By convention the action's command [type] is

 * is exactly one string per action and no drift between agent, server, and UI.
 *
 * The agent advertises [ADVERTISED_KEYS] in `capabilities.device`; the server flattens each into a
 * `device.<key>` token (see `AgentCapabilityTokens`).

# MDMesh setup wizard. Generates secrets, writes .env, brings up the Docker stack, and seeds a
# functional admin with a generated password. Re-runnable: an existing .env is reused as-is (so
# secrets stay stable) and a database that already holds data is never re-seeded — a re-run just
# rebuilds/redeploys code and applies idempotent repairs.
#
# Usage: ./setup.sh            # interactive Docker setup (re-run safe: reuses .env, keeps data)
#        ./setup.sh --reset    # regenerate .env + secrets from scratch. ONLY safe with a fresh
